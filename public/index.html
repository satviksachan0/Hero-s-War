      <h2>Game Rules</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> Eliminate all of your opponent's pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Setup:</strong> The game is played on a 5x5 grid. Each player
        controls 5 characters: Pawns (P), Hero1s (H1), and Hero2s (H2). Pieces
        are placed on the first and last rows of the board for each player.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Character Movements:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pawn (P):</strong> Moves one block in any direction (Left,
          Right, Forward, or Backward).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hero1 (H1):</strong> Moves two blocks straight in any
          direction. Can capture any opponent's piece in its path.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hero2 (H2):</strong> Moves two blocks diagonally in any
          direction. Can capture any opponent's piece in its path.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Turn-Based Play:</strong> Players alternate turns. A move is
        only valid if it adheres to the character's movement rules and targets
        an empty cell or an opponent's piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Winning:</strong> The game ends when a player has eliminated all
        of the opponent's pieces. The player who achieves this first is declared
        the winner.
